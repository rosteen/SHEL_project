Abstract:
    We report the discovery of the low-density, transiting giant planet
    WASP-31b. The planet is 0.48 Jupiter masses and 1.55 Jupiter radii. It
    is in a 3.4-day orbit around a metal-poor, late-F-type, V=11.7 dwarf
    star, which is a member of a common proper motion pair. In terms of
    its low density, WASP-31b is second only to WASP-17b, which is a more
    highly irradiated planet of similar mass.

Description:
    The host star WASP-31 was observed by WASP-South during 2006 to 2011.
    The WASP photometry was corrected for blending with a star 4.1mag
    fainter, located 35arcsec away. Spectroscopic measurements were
    obtained using the CORALIE spectrograph mounted on the Euler-Swiss
    1.2-m telescope (La Silla, Chile) and the HARPS spectrograph mounted
    on the ESO 3.6-m telescope (La Silla, Chile) to confirm the planetary
    nature of the eclipsing body and to measure its mass. A total of 47
    measurements were obtained by CORALIE, 1 of which fell during transit,
    and 10 measurements were obtained by HARPS. The data are plotted in
    Figures 1, 2 and 3.

Note on phot.dat: The FTN transit (2m Faulkes Telescope North) was obtained
     through a Pan-STARRS-z filter on 2010 Feb 26. The Euler transit (1.2m)
     was obtained through a  Gunn-r filter on 2010 Apr 15.
