Abstract:
    We present FORS2 (attached to ESO's Very Large Telescope) observations
    of the exoplanet WASP-17b during its primary transit, for the purpose
    of differential spectrophotometry analysis. We use the instrument in
    its Mask eXchange Unit (MXU) mode to simultaneously obtain low
    resolution spectra of the planet hosting star, as well as several
    reference stars in the field of view. The integration of these spectra
    within broadband and smaller 100{AA} bins provides us with 'white' and
    spectrophotometric light curves, from 5700 to 8000{AA}. Through
    modelling the white light curve, we obtain refined bulk and transit
    parameters of the planet, as well as wavelength-dependent variations
    of the planetary radius from smaller spectral bins through which the
    transmission spectrum is obtained. The inference of transit
    parameters, as well as the noise statistics, is performed using a
    Gaussian Process model. We achieve a typical precision in the transit
    depth of a few hundred parts per million from various transit light
    curves. From the transmission spectra we rule out a flat spectrum at
    >3{sigma} and detect marginal presence of the pressure-broadened
    sodium wings. Furthermore, we detect the wing of the potassium
    absorption line in the upper atmosphere of the planet with 3-{sigma}
    confidence, both facts pointing to a relatively shallow temperature
    gradient in the atmosphere. These conclusions are mostly consistent
    with previous studies of this exo-atmosphere, although previous
    potassium measurements have been inconclusive.

Description:
    In producing the transmission spectrum, we model spectrophotometric
    light curves, produced with small integration bins throughout
    wavelength domain. The data for all the light curves presented in
    Figure 7 are given. These are normalised light curves that are also
    corrected for the common mode systematics. From modelling these light
    curves using Gaussian processes, we detect signature of Potassium in
    the atmosphere this exoplanet, WASP-17b.
